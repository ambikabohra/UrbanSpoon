<h2><i>RESTAURANTS' TRACKER WEBSITE</i></h2>
<p>
    Multiple websites are available today for food ordering and restaurant recommendation. There is no website which provides suggestions about establishing a new restaurant. Restaurants should adapt to the choices of the people for a profitable business. Before opening a new restaurant, one should check which cuisine best works for that place. The restaurant owner must have an outlook of competitors.
